Verify that $p(x)$ is a probability mass function.\nb. Find $P(X \\geq 2)$.\nc. Find $P(X \\geq 2 | X \\geq 1)$.\nd. Find $P(X \\geq 1 \\cup X \\geq 2)$.\n\n\n### Part (a)\n\nTo be a valid probability function $p(x)$ must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n- $p(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x$.\n- $\\sum_{x} p(x) = 1$.\n\nThe first condition is satisfied by construction. The second condition is satisfied by the following calculation:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{x} p(x) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = 1\n$$\n\n### Part (b)\n\nWe can use the union rule as:\n\n$$\nP(X \\geq 2) = P(X = 2) + P(X = 3)\n$$\n\n$$\nP(X \\geq 2) = \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\n\n### Part(c)\n\nWe can use conditional probability as:\n\n$$\nP(X \\geq 2 | X \\geq 1) = \\frac{P(X \\geq 2 \\cap X \\geq 1)}{P(X \\geq 1)}\n$$\n\nSince $X \\geq 2$ is a subset of $X \\geq 1$, we have that:\n\n$$\nP(X \\geq 2 \\cap X \\geq 1) = P(X \\geq 2)\n$$\n\nAnd Finally:\n\n$$\nP(X \\geq 2 | X \\geq 1) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\n\n### Part (d)\n\nWe can use the union rule as:\n\n$$\nP(X \\geq 1 \\cup X \\geq 2) = P(X \\geq 1) + P(X \\geq 2) \\\\ - P(X \\geq 1 \\cap X \\geq 2)\n$$\n\nThen, similarly to part (c), we can use the intersection rule as:\n\n$$\nP(X \\geq 1 \\cap X \\geq 2) = (X \\geq 2)\n$$\n\n$$\nP(X \\geq 1 \\cap X \\geq 2) = \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\n\nAnd finally:\n\n$$\nP(X \\geq 1 \\cup X \\geq 2) = \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}\n$$\n\n## Problem 3.2\n\n**Let $X$ be a discrete random variable with probability mass function given by**\n\n$$\np(x) = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{1}{4} &  x = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} &  x = 1 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{8} &  x = 2 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{8} &  x = 3 \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\na.

This problem explores the math behind pooled testing. Since the availability of tests is limited, the testing center proposes the following pooled testing technique:**\n\n* Two samples are randomly selected and combined. The combined sample is tested.\n* If the combined sample tests negative, then both people are assumed negative.\n* If the combined sample tests positive, then both people need to be retested for the disease.\n\nSuppose in a certain population, 5% of the people being tested for COVID-19 actually have COVID-19. Let $X$ be the total number of tests that are run in order to test two randomly selected people.\n\na. What is the pmf of $X$?\nb. What is the expected value of $X$?\nc. Repeat the above, but imagine that three samples are combined, and let $Y$ be the total number of tests that are run in order to test three randomly selected people. If the pooled test is positive, then all three people need to be retested individually.\nd. If your only concern is to minimize the expected number of tests given to the population, which technique would you recommend?\n\n### Part (a)\n\nTo find the pmf of $X$, we need to determine the probability of each possible value of $X$:\n\nFirst, consider the case where neither of the two individuals selected has COVID-19. The probability that the first individual selected does not have COVID-19 is 0.95, and the probability that the second individual selected does not have COVID-19, given that the first individual does not have COVID-19, is also 0.95. Therefore, the probability that neither individual has COVID-19 is:\n\n$$\nP = 0.95 \\cdot 0.95 = 0.9025\n$$\n\nIn this case, only one test is needed, since the combined sample will test negative and both individuals can be assumed negative. So, in this case, X = 1 with probability 0.9025.\n\nNow, consider the case where one or both of the individuals selected has COVID-19. The probability that at least one has COVID-19 is the complement of the probability that neither has COVID-19:\n$$\nP = 1 - 0.9025 = 0.0975\n$$\n\nIn this case, the combined sample will test positive, and both individuals will need to be retested. Since each individual will need to be tested once more, a total of three tests will be needed. So, in this case, X = 3 with probability 0.0975.\n\n| X  | Probability   |\n|----|---------------|\n| 1  | 0.9025        |\n| 3  | 0.0975        |\n\n### Part (b)\n\n$$\nE[x] = 1 \\cdot 0.9025 + 3 \\cdot 0.0975 = 1.195\n$$\n\n### Part (c)\n\nTo find the pmf of $Y$, we need to determine the probability of each possible value of $Y$:\n\n$$\nP = 0.95 \\cdot 0.95 \\cdot 0.95 = 0.857375\n$$\n\nIn this case, only one test is needed, since the combined sample will test negative and all three individuals can be assumed negative. So, in this case, Y = 1 with probability 0.857375.\n\nNow consider the case where one or more of the individuals selected has COVID-19. The probability that at least one individual has COVID-19 is:\n\n$$\nP = 1 - 0.857375 = 0.142625\n$$\n\nIn this case, the combined sample will test positive, and all three individuals will need to be retested. Since each individual will need to be tested once more, a total of four tests will be needed. So, in this case, Y = 4 with probability 0.142625.\n\n| Y  | Probability   |\n|----|---------------|\n| 1  | 0.857375      |\n| 4  | 0.142625      |\n\nAnd the expected value of $Y$ is:\n\n$$\nE[y] = 1 \\cdot 0.857375 + 4 \\cdot 0.142625 = 1.442\n$$\n\n### Part (d)\n\nSince the expected value of $X$ is 1.195 and the expected value of $Y$ is 1.442, we would recommend the technique that minimizes the expected number of tests, which is the technique that tests two samples at a time.\n\n\n## Problem 3.11\n\n**A roulette wheel has 38 slots and a ball that rolls until it falls into one of the slots, all of which are equally likely.

Then, the ball lands on black or green on the second spin, and you lose \\$2.\n3. The ball lands on red on both spins, and you win $1 on the first spin and \\$2 on the second spin.\n\nThe probability of each of these outcomes can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. Probability of losing on the first spin: $\\frac{20}{38} = 0.5263$\n2. Probability of winning on the first spin and losing on the second spin $\\frac{18}{38} \\cdot \\frac{20}{38} = 0.2493$\n3.

If you lose again, you double your bet to \\$4 (having already lost \\$3). Again, if you win, you have \\$1 profit, and if you lose, you double your bet again.

If you play the bet doubling strategy with a \\$127 bankroll, how many times can you expect to play before you lose your bankroll?\n\n### Part (a)\n\nThe maximum number of bets you can lose in a row without losing your bankroll is 7. \n\n- Bet 1: Lose \\$1, bankroll is now \\$126\n- Bet 2: Lose \\$2, bankroll is now \\$124\n- Bet 3: Lose \\$4, bankroll is now \\$120\n- Bet 4: Lose \\$8, bankroll is now \\$112\n- Bet 5: Lose \\$16, bankroll is now \\$96\n- Bet 6: Lose \\$32, bankroll is now \\$64\n- Bet 7: Lose \\$64, bankroll is now \\$0\n\n### part (b)\n\nThe proability of losing all 7 bets is $(\\frac{20}{38})^7$.

It pays \\$600.\nb. \\$1 Front Pair wins if you correctly guess the first two digits. It pays \\$60.\nc. \\$1 Back Pair wins if you correctly guess the last two digits. It pays \\$60.\nd. \\$6 6-Way Combo wins if the three digits are different and you guess all three in any order. It pays \\$600.\ne. \\$3 3-Way Combo wins if two of the three digits are the same, and you guess all three in any order. It pays \\$600.\nf. \\$1 1-Off lets you win if some of your digits are off by 1 (9 and 0 are considered to be one off from each other). If you get the number exactly correct, you win \\$300. If you have one digit off by 1, you win \\$29. If you have two digits off by 1, you win \\$4, and if all three of your digits are off by 1 you win \\$9.\n\n**Consider the value of your bet to be your expected winnings per dollar bet. What value do each of these bets have?**\n\n\n### Part (a)\n\\$1 Straight wins if you correctly guess all three digits, in order. It pays \\$600.\n\nThe total amount of money you can win is \\$(600 - 1). The total amount of money you can lose is \\$1. The proability of winning is $\\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{1}{n}$ where $n=10$ and the probability of losing is the complement. Thus, the expected value of this bet is:\n\n$$\nE[X] = (600 - 1) \\cdot \\frac{1}{1000} - 1 \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{1000}\\right) = -0.4\n$$\n\nWe can also simulate this in R as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='discrete-random-variables_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-8_83c9538f61e887543f52965f32538771'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nevent <- replicate(100000 , {\n  my_bet <- sample(x = 0:999, size = 1, replace = TRUE)\n  lottery <- sample(x = 0:999, size = 1, replace = TRUE)\n  if(lottery == my_bet) 599 else -1\n})\n\nmean(event)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] -0.37\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Part (b)\n\n\\$1 Front Pair wins if you correctly guess the first two digits. It pays \\$60.\n\nQuite similar to the previous part, the total amount of money you can win is \\$(60 - 1). The total amount of money you can lose is \\$1. The proability of winning is $\\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{1}{n}$ where $n=10$ and the probability of losing is the complement. Thus, the expected value of this bet is:\n\n$$\nE[X] = (60 - 1) \\cdot \\frac{1}{100}  - 1 \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{100}\\right) = -0.4\n$$\n\nWe can also simulate this in R as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='discrete-random-variables_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-9_a561298ef09718e82ed5c2c126c93493'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nevent <- replicate(100000 , {\n  my_bet <- sample(x = 0:99, size = 1, replace = TRUE)\n  lottery <- sample(x = 0:999, size = 1, replace = TRUE)\n  if(lottery %/% 10 == my_bet) 59 else -1\n})\n\nmean(event)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] -0.3958\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Part (c)\n\\$1 Back Pair wins if you correctly guess the last two digits. It pays \\$60.\n\nIt's basically the same. So, let's just calculate the expected value:\n\n$$\nE[X] = (60 - 1) \\cdot \\frac{1}{100}  - 1 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{100}\\right) = -0.4\n$$\n\nAnd just for the record, here is the simulation:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='discrete-random-variables_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-10_008424b0814b76d7b28611add846f8b4'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nevent <- replicate(100000 , {\n  my_bet <- sample(x = 0:99, size = 1, replace = TRUE)\n  lottery <- sample(x = 0:999, size = 1, replace = TRUE)\n  if(lottery %% 100 == my_bet) 59 else -1\n})\n\nmean(event)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] -0.4174\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Part (d)\n\n\\$6 6-Way Combo wins if the three digits are different and you guess all three in any order. It pays \\$600.\n\nWith a 3-digit number (All digits different) we have 6 ($3!$) ways to guess all three digits in any order. So it means that the probability of winning is $\\frac{6}{1000}$. Thus the expected value is:\n\n$$\nE[X] = (600 - 6) \\cdot \\frac{6}{1000}  - 6 \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{6}{1000}\\right) = -2.4\n$$\n\nWe can simulate this in R as follow:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='discrete-random-variables_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-11_1a198c8cc0dcffc75d5296018e062650'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nevent <- replicate(100000, {\n  my_bet <- sample(x = 0:9, size = 3, replace = FALSE)\n  lottery <- sample(x = 0:9, size = 3, replace = TRUE)\n  if(all(my_bet %in% lottery)) 594 else -6\n})\n\nmean(event)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] -2.202\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Part (e)\n\n\\$3 3-Way Combo wins if two of the three digits are the same, and you guess all three in any order. It pays \\$600.\n\nWith a 3-digit number where 2 digits are the same we have 3 ways to guess all three digits in any order. So it means that the probability of winning is $\\frac{3}{1000}$. Thus the expected value is:\n\n$$\nE[X] = (600 - 3) \\cdot \\frac{3}{1000}  - 3 \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{3}{1000}\\right) = -1.2\n$$\n\nWe can simulate this in R as follow:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='discrete-random-variables_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-12_6988b0af69d3afc6ba5b5768af55e2ba'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nevent <- replicate(100000, {\n  my_bet <- sample(x = 0:9, size = 2, replace = FALSE)\n  my_bet <- c(my_bet, my_bet[1])\n  lottery <- sample(x = 0:9, size = 3, replace = TRUE)\n  if(identical(sort(my_bet), sort(lottery))) 597 else -3\n})\n\n\nmean(event)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] -1.248\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Part (f)\n\n\\$1 1-Off lets you win if some (*of your digits are off by 1 (9 and 0 are considered to be one off from each other). If you get the number exactly correct, you win \\$300. If you have one digit off by 1, you win \\$29. If you have two digits off by 1, you win \\$4, and if all three of your digits are off by 1 you win \\$9.\n\nThis case is a combination of the previous cases. So, let's calculate the expected value:\n\n$$\nE[X] = (300 - 1) \\cdot \\frac{1}{1000} + (29 - 1) \\cdot \\frac{6}{1000} +\n$$\n\n$$\n (4 - 1) \\cdot \\frac{6}{1000} + (9 - 1) \\cdot \\frac{2}{1000} - 1 \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{15}{1000}\\right) = -0.484\n$$\n\nWe can simulate this in R as follow:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='discrete-random-variables_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-13_d5376e8f1beef2aeec245ba6bb268740'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nevent <- replicate(100000, {\n  my_bet <- sample(x = 0:9, size = 3, replace = TRUE)\n  lottery <- sample(x = 0:9, size = 3, replace = TRUE)\n  \n  diff <- abs(my_bet - lottery)\n\n  if(identical(my_bet, lottery)) 299\n  else if(sum(diff) == 1) 28\n  else if(all(diff <= 1) && sum(diff) == 2) 3\n  else if(all(diff <= 1) && sum(diff) == 3) 8\n  else -1\n\n})\n\nmean(event)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] -0.38679\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Problem 3.15\n\n**Let $k$ be a positive integer and let $X$ be a random variable with pmf given by $p(x) = 1/k$ for $x=1,...,k$ and $p(x) = 0$ for all other values of $x$.
