# Book's problems and solutions

This is a guide that contains solutions to several problems I have solved during my studies. It's a work in progress, so I'll be adding more problems and solutions as I go.

## Structure

Each book chapter is represented by a qmd file, which is a Quarto markdown file. Every book has its own folder, where you can find all the related files. The structure of the project looks like this:

```bash
learning.jsantanders.dev/
├── book-1/
│   ├── chapter-1.qmd
│   ├── chapter-2.qmd
│   └── images/
├── book-2/
│   ├── chapter-1.qmd
│   ├── chapter-2.qmd
│   └── images/
├── book-3/
│   ├── chapter-1.qmd
│   ├── chapter-2.qmd
│   └── images/
└── README.md
```

In each book folder, you can find the qmd files for each chapter and an images folder where all the images used in the book are stored.
